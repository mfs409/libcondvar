 *
 *  Note that unlike pthread_cond_t, this condition variable implementation
 *  does not suffer from spurious wakeups.
 *
 *  The algorithm relies on each thread having its own semaphore, and
 *  performing wait() by enqueueing its semaphore on a per-condvar queue.  To
 *  this end, there is a fourth function in the API, thread_init, which we
 *  use to register a thread so that it can safely use condvars (i.e., so
